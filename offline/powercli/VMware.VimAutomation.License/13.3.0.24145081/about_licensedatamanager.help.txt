SHORT DESCRIPTION
    LicenseDataManager is used to control how license data is associated with
    inventory nodes. Presence of such license data makes it possible to support
    automatic licensing.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    LicenseDataManager allows for extending the vCenter Server inventory with
    license data associated with inventory nodes. The license data consists of
    VMware licensing material and takes the form of a list of {license type id,
    license key} pairs. The inventory nodes which can be associated with license
    data are individual hosts or host containers, such as clusters, data
    centers, and data center folders. Presence of such license data makes it
    possible to support automatic licensing when hosts are added to a particular
    host container entity.
    LicenseDataManager provides methods for retrieving, creating, modifying, and
    removing associations between license data and inventory nodes.

    ---

    TYPE
    VMware.VimAutomation.License.Types.LicenseDataManager

    DESCRIPTION:
    Provides methods for retrieving, creating, modifying, and removing
    associations between license data and inventory nodes.

    METHOD:
    VMware.VimAutomation.License.Types.EntityLicenseData[]
    QueryEntityLicenseData() - Retrieves all entity<->license data associations.

    METHOD:
    VMware.VimAutomation.License.Types.LicenseData
    QueryAssociatedLicenseData(VMware.Vim.ManagedObjectReference entity) -
    Retrieves the license data associated with the given inventory entity.

    METHOD:
    System.Void UpdateAssociatedLicenseData(VMware.Vim.ManagedObjectReference
    entity, VMware.VimAutomation.License.Types.LicenseData licenseData) -
    Overwrites the license data associated with the given inventory entity.

    METHOD:
    VMware.VimAutomation.License.Types.LicenseData
    QueryEffectiveLicenseData(VMware.Vim.ManagedObjectReference entity) -
    Retrieves the merged license data associated with the given entity and its
    host container predecessors (in the context of the inventory).

    METHOD:
    VMware.VimAutomation.License.Types.LicenseData
    ApplyAssociatedLicenseData(VMware.Vim.ManagedObjectReference entity) -
    Applies associated license data to an entity. The license data to apply is
    derived using the same rules as in
    QueryEffectiveLicenseData(VMware.Vim.ManagedObjectReference entity). In case
    of host container entity, this method finds all hosts below the specified
    container (in the context of the inventory) and applies the license data to
    each of the hosts.
