.DESCRIPTION

The ServicesAppliedConfig.FilterSpec structure specifies the matching criteria to be applied when filtering out ServicesAppliedConfig.Summary structures from the collection returned by the list method. Only ServicesAppliedConfig.Summary structures containing the values specified in this structure will be returned from the list method. If multiple members of the filter spec are set, all of them must match for a result to be filtered out and returned.

.PARAMETER Health
The health of the applied Attestation Service configuration. If unset, no filtration will be performed by health.
.PARAMETER Address
The network address of the Attestation Service configured for use in the Trusted Cluster. If unset, no filtration will be performed by network address.
